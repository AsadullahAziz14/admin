	<strong>What is C++?</strong></li>
	<p>C++ is a programming language. It literally means &quot;increased C&quot;, reflecting its nature as an evolution of the C language.</p>
	<strong>What is OOP: Object-oriented programming?</strong>
	<p>It is a programming model that treats programming from a perspective where each component is considered an object, with its own properties and methods, replacing or complementing structured programming paradigm, where the focus was on procedures and parameters.</p>
	<strong>How can I make windowed programs?</strong>
	<p>You need a C++ compiler that can link code for your windowing environment (Windows, XWindow, MacOS, ...). Windowed programs do not generally use the console to communicate with the user. They use a set of functions or classes to manipulate windows instead, which are specific to each environment. Anyway the same principles apply both for console and windowed programs, except for communicating with the user.</p>
	<strong>What is Visual C++? And what does &quot;visual programming&quot; mean?</strong>
	<p>Visual C++ is the name of a C++ compiler with an integrated environment from Microsoft. It includes special tools that simplify the development of large applications as well as specific libraries that improve productivity. The use of these tools is generally known as visual programming. Other manufacturers also develop these types of tools and libraries, like Borland C++, Visual Age, etc...</p>
	<strong>Is C++ a proprietary language?</strong>
	<p>No. No one owns the C++ language. Anyone can use the language royalty-free.</p>
	<strong>What is ANSI-C++?</strong>
	<p>ANSI-C++ is the name by which the international ANSI/ISO standard for the C++ language is known. But before this standard was published, C++ was already widely used and therefore there is a lot of code out there written in pre-standard C++. Referring to ANSI-C++ explicitly differenciates it from pre-standard C++ code, which is incompatible in some ways.</p>
