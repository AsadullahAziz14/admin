	<p> a class that can only be used as a base class for some other class. A class is abstract if it has at least one pure virtual function.</p>
	<p>	access control :</p>
	<p>a C++ mechanism for prohibiting or granting access to individual	members of a class. See public, private, protected, and visibility.</p>
	<p>	access declaration :</p>
	<p>	a way of controlling access to a specified member of a base class when it is used in a derived class.</p>
	<p>	access specifier :</p>
	<p>	a way of labelling members of a class to specify what access is permitted. See public, private, and protected.</p>
	<p>	aggregate :</p>
	<p>	an array or object of a class with no constructors, no private or protected members, no base classes, and no virtual functions. See initializer<br />
		and initialization.</p>
	<p>	allocation :</p>
	<p>	the process of giving memory space to an object. See dynamic storage, static storage, and deallocation.</p>
	<p>	ANSI :</p>
	<p>	acronym for American National Standards Institute, a standards body	currently standardizing C++.</p>
	<p>	argument :</p>
	<p>	when calling a function, refers to the actual values passed to the function. See parameter.</p>
	<p>	argument matching :</p>
	<p>	the process of determining which of a set of functions of a specified name matches given arguments in a function call.</p>
	<p>	ARM :</p>
	<p>	acronym for the book The C++ Annotated Reference Manual, a C++ reference book by Ellis and Stroustrup.</p>
	<p>	array :</p>
	<p>	an ordered and indexable sequence of values. C++ supports arrays of a single dimension (a vector) or of multiple dimensions.</p>
	<p>	asm :</p>
	<p>	C++ keyword used to specify assembly language in the middle of C++ code.</p>
	<p>	assignment :</p>
	<p>	the process of giving a value to a pre-existing object. See	copy constructor and initialization.</p>
	<p>	assignment operator :</p>
	<p>	an operator for doing assignment. See also copy constructor.</p>
	<p>	auto:</p>
	<p>	a C++ keyword used to declare a stack-based local variable in a function. This is the default and is normally not needed. See storage class.</p>
	<p>	base class :</p>
	<p>	a class that serves as a base for a derived class to inherit members from. See inheritance.</p>
	<p>	bit field :</p>
	<p>	a member of a class that represents small integral values.</p>
	<p>	bitwise copy :</p>
	<p>	to copy an object without regard to its structure or members. See memberwise copy.</p>
	<p>	bool :</p>
	<p>	C++ keyword used to declare a Boolean data type.</p>
	<p>	break :</p>
	<p>	C++ keyword used to specify a statement that is used to break out of a for or while loop or out of a switch statement.</p>
	<p>	browser:</p>
	<p>	a software development tool used for viewing class declarations and the class hierarchy. See programming environment.</p>
	<p>	C :</p>
	<p>	a programming language in widespread use. C++ is based on C.</p>
